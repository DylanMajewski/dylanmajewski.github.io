        This project was a group project for my CS 340 class at Oregon State University to demonstrate our understanding of databases. The project was to create a database for a travel website.

<b>Overview of idea from the class:</b><br>
&Tab;TripQuick is a website/web application tool that is used to assist, plan, and finalize travel itineraries for any single destination trips that a traveler may desire. Rather than booking a flight on one website, booking a reservation on another, and a hotel booking on, yet again, another website; TripQuick is a single-source solution where common forms of travel reservations can be scheduled and reserved, including destination activities.<br><br>
&Tab;TripQuick is projected to have roughly 10,000 monthly users and requires a database to track and record the accompanying information. Information of such things relating to the traveler, accommodations, flights, any possible activity reservations, and their living situation while they are out on their trip. Ultimately, this database would serve to keep and maintain the needed information that travelers will need on their trip, every step of the way.<br><br>

<b>Redactions:</b><br>
&Tab;Please note that things were redacted/amended to ensure academic integrity, privacy, and to protect sensitive information. As a result, the codebase will not deploy and function properly without the redacted code being reinserted.<br><br>

<b>General Citations:</b><br>
&Tab;Code related to Flask and interacting with the database is mostly based on a course-given flask starter code and example code. Styling and structure of the HTML is adapted from Dylan Majewski's Portfolio which is in turn based on the templates given in respective course. See citations in source code for more details and exceptions.

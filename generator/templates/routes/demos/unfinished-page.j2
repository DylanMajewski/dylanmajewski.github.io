            This page is an unfinished page; what did you expect?
        </p>
        <p>
            I made this page because it was the placeholder from one of my first projects and I wanted to keep it. It is nice to switch to this page for a quick laugh when something else was frustrating to code.<br />
            Thanks for visiting! (^_^)
